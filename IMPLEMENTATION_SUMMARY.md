# Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Service Image Upload System
- **Database**: The `schemes` table already had `image_url` column ready for storing uploaded image paths
- **Admin Interface**: Replaced URL input field with proper file upload component in `/dashboard/admin/services`
- **Upload API**: Utilizes existing `/api/upload` endpoint that stores files in Supabase Storage
- **Display**: Service display pages automatically show uploaded images from the `image_url` field

### 2. PDF Receipt Logo Removal
Updated all PDF generation components to remove Ganesha logo and use plain orange background:
- `src/components/ReceiptsList.tsx` - Service receipts
- `src/app/dashboard/orders/[id]/receipt/page.tsx` - Individual order receipts  
- `src/app/dashboard/orders/page.tsx` - Order receipts from orders page
- `src/app/api/certificates/download/route.ts` - Certificate downloads

### 3. WhatsApp Notification System (Rebuilt from Scratch)
- **Cleared Data**: Removed all existing data from `whatsapp_notifications` table
- **New System**: Created `src/lib/whatsapp-new.ts` with clean implementation
- **Real-time Trigger**: Created `src/lib/whatsapp-trigger.ts` for automatic notifications
- **Integration**: Added `WhatsAppNotificationTrigger` component to dashboard layout
- **Admin Only**: Only sends notifications when admin creates new schemes

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Service Image Upload
1. Login as admin
2. Go to `/dashboard/admin/services`
3. Click "Add New Service" 
4. Upload an image file (PNG, JPG, GIF up to 5MB)
5. Fill other required fields and save
6. Verify image appears in admin service list
7. Go to `/dashboard/services` as retailer
8. Verify uploaded image displays correctly

### Test 2: PDF Receipts Without Logo
1. Create a service application as retailer
2. Approve it as admin/employee to generate receipt
3. Download receipt from `/dashboard/receipts`
4. Verify PDF has plain orange header without Ganesha logo
5. Test other receipt types (orders, certificates) similarly

### Test 3: WhatsApp Notifications for New Schemes
1. Ensure you have active retailers/employees with phone numbers in database
2. Login as admin
3. Create a new service/scheme in `/dashboard/admin/services`
4. Check browser console for WhatsApp notification logs
5. Check `whatsapp_notifications` table for logged entries
6. Verify message format includes scheme details and admin contact (9764664021)

## ðŸ“‹ Database Requirements

Ensure these users exist with phone numbers for WhatsApp testing:
```sql
-- Check users with phone numbers
SELECT id, name, email, phone, role, is_active 
FROM users 
WHERE role IN ('RETAILER', 'EMPLOYEE') 
AND is_active = true 
AND phone IS NOT NULL 
AND phone != '';
```

## ðŸ”§ Manual WhatsApp Testing

If automatic notifications don't work, you can manually trigger them:
```javascript
// In browser console on admin dashboard
import { manuallyTriggerSchemeNotification } from '@/lib/whatsapp-trigger';
manuallyTriggerSchemeNotification('scheme-id-here');
```
